This is a Perl port of code acompanying:

http://blacksheep.parry.org/archives/diy-di/print/

In each directory there is added a test.pl script that runs
some simple tests to ensure that the refactoring was correct.

There are also some mock implementations of the base classes
needed for the tests to run - they are in the 'external' directory.
